# **Global Economic Development Analysis (1960-2018)**

## üìä **Project Overview**

This project analyzes global economic development trends between 1960 and 2018. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as GDP, population, and Human Development Index (HDI) to visualize the growth and shifts in different regions over time. Using data from the World Bank and Human Development Index datasets, this project aims to provide insights into how economic output, population, and human development have evolved globally.

## üîç **Key Objectives**

1. **Data Preparation & Quality Assurance:**
   - Import and clean World Bank and HDI datasets.
   - Calculate population figures based on GDP and GDP per capita.
   - Filter and join datasets for meaningful analysis.

2. **Data Transformation for Visualization:**
   - Create pivot tables for GDP and population by region.
   - Compute regional averages for HDI.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - **GDP Growth Over Time:** Stacked area chart showing regional GDP trends.
   - **Population Growth:** Stacked area chart showing population changes by region.
   - **Life Expectancy & GDP:** Bubble chart highlighting life expectancy vs GDP per capita.
   - **HDI by Region:** Bar chart showing the average HDI for each region.
   - **Power Consumption & GDP:** Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between power consumption and GDP per capita.

4. **Final Report:**
   - Integrate all visualizations into a cohesive report with annotations and insights.

## üìÇ **Dataset Sources**

- **World Bank Data:** Includes GDP, GDP per capita, population, and other economic indicators.
- **HDI Data:** Human Development Index values by country for 2014.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas` ‚Äì For data manipulation.
  - `numpy` ‚Äì For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` ‚Äì For creating visualizations.
  - `seaborn` ‚Äì For advanced visualization features.
- **Google Colab** ‚Äì For collaborative coding and execution.
